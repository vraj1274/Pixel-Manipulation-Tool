# Pixel-Manipulation-Tool
🎨 A Python-based Pixel Manipulation Tool that lets you encrypt, decrypt, or analyze image pixels using custom logic. Ideal for experimenting with image processing, cryptography, or visual data encodin
# 🖼️ Pixel Manipulation Tool – Python

A Python tool for manipulating image pixels. Designed for developers and researchers interested in image encryption, steganography, or pixel-based analysis.

## 🎯 What It Does

- 🔐 Encrypts image pixels using custom algorithms
- 🔓 Decrypts manipulated image data to reconstruct the original image
- 🧠 Allows experimentation with pixel data structures (RGB, grayscale, etc.)
- 🧪 Useful for data encoding, steganography, or AI-based image research

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ Read and process image files (PNG, JPG, etc.)
- ✅ Pixel-by-pixel data access and transformation
- ✅ Save encrypted or modified images
- ✅ Easy integration into Flask, Django, or CLI tools
- ✅ Built with `PIL` (Pillow), `NumPy`, and `OpenCV` (optional)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install pillow numpy opencv-python
